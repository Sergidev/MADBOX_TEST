-The time it took you to perform the exercise

Without this document, 4h30min.

- The parts that were difficult for you and why

To implement the player movement with Bézier curves was the 
hardest part. With a simple Vector3.MoveTowards() the curves felt clumsy
and killed the player experience. I knew about Bézier curves but 
I never implemented something like that before. It took me a lot of time,
but it's a core feature and I think it deserves all the time I invested.

- The parts you think you could do better and how

The road could be better positioned but I didn't had 
enough time to place on the perfect X,Y,X coordinates 
all the parts. I tried to do curves on the road to show 
how the Bézier curves and camera rotations fit very well 
in this game, but with only boxes the road feels poor 
unless it would have been just a straight path. But a straight 
path would have been even poorer. The camera rotations with Lerp() 
is so agressive too, I would have liked to improve it, but I had 
no time and I priorized to make an ended product, with things to polish.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

The original game is online, so implement that would be great, and 
in addition, it would be really great to implement player skills, like 
a dash or push other players, throw a bomb, some mechanics like Mario Kart 
does to have a real epic race with all the runners!

- What did you think

I was really nervous, at the beginning I thought the time would win me the
match, but I priorized the things to implement after play a little bit the game
and I'm proud with the results and I really enjoyed this test. I would have liked
to code more complex traps, but again, I had no tine enough.

- Any comment you may have

Thank you Madbox to give me this chance, I feel wiser and tanning as a developer
after this test. It would be great work with you. See you soon!
